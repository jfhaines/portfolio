            Hi, I'm Joe. I studied a Bachelor of Business Management at the University of Queensland
            from 2016 to 2019. After graduation, I got a job as a Social Media Coordinator at Entain,
            working in this position for just under three years. During this period, in my free time, 
            I finally decided to learn how to code, which was an interest that I had had for quite
            some time. I looked into the various programming languages and the different areas of 
            programming, and I eventually landed on Javascript & web development. First, I began 
            learning HTML, CSS to provide a solid foundation, and then moved onto frontend vanilla 
            JavaScript. Later on, I learned how to create a backend application using NodeJS & the 
            Express framework. Entain recently offered an internal scholarship to be put into Coder 
            Academy's Accelerated Web Development program, and I jumped at the
            opportunity. And now here I am.
