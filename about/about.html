            Hi, I'm Joe. I studied a Bachelor of Business Management at the University of Queensland
            from 2016 to 2019. After graduation, I got a job as a Social Media Coordinator at Entain,
            working in this position for just under three years. During this period, in my free time, 
            I finally decided to learn how to code, which was an interest that I had had for quite
            some time. I looked into the various programming languages and the different areas of 
            programming, and I eventually landed on Javascript & web development. First, I began 
            learning HTML, CSS to provide a solid foundation, and then moved onto frontend vanilla 
            JavaScript. Later on, I learned how to create a backend application using NodeJS & the 
            Express framework. Entain recently offered an internal scholarship to be put into Coder 
            Academy's Accelerated Web Development program, and I jumped at the opportunity. Now here 
            I am as a web developer in training. If interested, you can find my resume linked below.

            Programming has been an interest of mine for a little while now, but this website probably gave that away already. 
            Other than that, I spend a lot of my free time at the gym and keeping up with my favourite sporting leagues,
            such as the NFL, NBA, MLB and Formula 1. My introverted side also loves to stay indoors and binge TV shows.
